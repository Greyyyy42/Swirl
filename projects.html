      <h2>My first project: Harmony bridge</h2>
      <p>My first school project; harmony bridge is a project I made with the help of my team. our goal was to make a swing bridge with s truss system that can score a low deflection magnitude by only using palm tree parts, as a prototype to solve the problem of urban congestion in Damietta Branch. The mechanism of the bridge is functioning by a servo motor controlled with an Arduino UNO and an ultrasonic sensor.</p>
